# Poweroff Scheduler
 
## Goal
 
Little bro has a Windows PC and stays up too late, so you want to help him disconnect. The goal is to shut down the computer without relying on parenting control tools as they are easily worked around. I could -and should- have gone for a service or something launched by the scheduler, but where is the fun in that?
