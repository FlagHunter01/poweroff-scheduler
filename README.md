## What is this for ? 

The idea behind this script is to create the ultimate screentime limiter. 

For a given user, this script allows you to set limits, shutting down the computer if it is too early or too late. 

> [!WARNING]
> Admin privileges are needed to install this script.

## Features

- [x] Define custom morning and evening limits for every day of the week.
    - [x] Windows will shut down if the time is before the morning or after the afternoon limit. 
    - [x] User sensitive: customize the schedule for multiple users.
- [x] Easely disable or delete the script for a user.
